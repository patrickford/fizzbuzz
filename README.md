# fizzbuzz
Basic FizzBuzz Application
==========================
The basic logic is as follows: 
-----------------------------
- Display an input form that takes one number.
- On a click event get the value of the input, call the fizzbuzz function, and reset the input value to blank.
- The fizzbuzz function will clear the output area from any previous run and iterate from 1 to the max value and display the appropriate output
