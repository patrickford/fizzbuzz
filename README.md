Basic FizzBuzz Application
==========================
The logic is as follows: 
-----------------------------
- Display an input form that takes one number
- On a click event get the value of the input
- Clear the output area from any previous run 
- Iterate from 1 to the max value
- Append a paragraph <p> element for each value
- Call the fizzbuzz function to get the inner text
- Reset the input value to blank.
